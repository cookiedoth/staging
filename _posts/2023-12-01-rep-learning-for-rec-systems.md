# Final Project Proposal

Much of our social media and content platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Netflix, etc. utilize recommender systems for provided personalized content and feeds. A crucial factor in delivering good recomendation system having an expressive embedding of user data and history. 

**I want to explore different representation learning algorithms to generate different embeddings to be used for recommendations / clusters and evaluate their accuracy.**

The application I will use to test this on will depend on the data availability. One domain I was initially thinking of was movie recommendation due to the prevalence of open-source data.

Some ideas that I have read about:

* Use large language models directly as a resource for recommending user content based on past likes and history
* Use graph / transformer neural networks by modeling user history as sequential data
* Use contrastive learning / autoencoders to build embedding vector of user past likes and history
